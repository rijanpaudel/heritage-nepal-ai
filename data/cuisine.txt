Traditional Nepali Cuisine

Dal Bhat is the staple meal of Nepal, consisting of lentil soup (dal) served with rice (bhat), vegetable curry (tarkari), and pickles (achar). Eaten twice daily by most Nepalis, it provides complete nutrition and sustained energy for mountain living.

Momos are Tibetan-style dumplings that have become Nepal's favorite street food. Traditionally steamed but also available fried, momos contain meat or vegetable fillings wrapped in wheat flour dough. They're served with spicy tomato-based dipping sauce called achar.

Newari cuisine is the traditional food of the Kathmandu Valley's Newar people. Specialties include Bara (black lentil pancakes), Chatamari (Nepali pizza made with rice flour), and Yomari (sweet dumplings filled with molasses and sesame seeds, eaten during festivals).
