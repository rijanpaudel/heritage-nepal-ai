Popular Trekking Routes in Nepal

The Annapurna Circuit is considered one of the world's best treks, circling the Annapurna massif over 160-230 kilometers depending on the route. Trekkers cross the Thorong La Pass at 5,416 meters and experience diverse landscapes from subtropical forests to high-altitude deserts.

Everest Base Camp trek reaches 5,364 meters and takes trekkers to the base of the world's highest mountain. The route passes through Sherpa villages, Buddhist monasteries, and offers stunning views of Everest, Lhotse, and Ama Dablam. Acclimatization is critical due to the altitude.

Langtang Valley trek, closer to Kathmandu, offers mountain views and cultural experiences with Tamang communities. The trek was severely affected by the 2015 earthquake, which caused avalanches that destroyed the village of Langtang. The region has since been rebuilt and welcomes trekkers.
