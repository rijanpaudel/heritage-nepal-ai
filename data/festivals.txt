Major Festivals of Nepal

Dashain is the longest and most significant festival in Nepal, celebrated for 15 days in September-October. It honors the goddess Durga's victory over evil demons. Families gather for blessings from elders who apply tika (red vermillion) and offer jamara (yellow barley shoots). Animal sacrifices are performed in temples and homes.

Tihar, also called Deepawali, is the festival of lights celebrated over five days. Each day honors different beings: crows, dogs, cows, oxen, and brothers. Homes are decorated with oil lamps and colorful rangoli patterns. The third day, Laxmi Puja, is the most important when people worship the goddess of wealth.

Holi, the festival of colors, celebrates the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. Celebrated in March, people throw colored powder and water at each other in joyful celebrations. In the Terai region, Holi is celebrated with particular enthusiasm, with community gatherings and traditional music.
