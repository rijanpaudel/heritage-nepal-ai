Kathmandu Valley Heritage Sites

Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites within the valley. The valley represents the historic and cultural heart of Nepal, showcasing traditional Newari architecture and ancient Buddhist and Hindu religious sites.

Swayambhunath Stupa, also known as the Monkey Temple, sits atop a hill west of Kathmandu. Dating back over 2,500 years, it is one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Nepal. The iconic white dome and golden spire are visible from most parts of the city. Pilgrims climb 365 steps to reach the main platform, which offers panoramic views of the valley.

Pashupatinath Temple is the most sacred Hindu temple in Nepal, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located on the banks of the Bagmati River, it attracts thousands of pilgrims during the Maha Shivaratri festival. Only Hindu devotees are allowed inside the main temple, but visitors can observe the complex from across the river.

Boudhanath Stupa is one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal and the center of Tibetan Buddhism in Kathmandu. The stupa's massive mandala makes it one of the largest in the world. Tibetan refugees built monasteries around the stupa after fleeing Tibet in the 1950s, creating a vibrant Buddhist community.

Kathmandu Durbar Square served as the royal palace complex for the Malla kings. The square contains dozens of temples, courtyards, and the old royal palace. Notable structures include the Taleju Temple, Kumari Ghar (home of the Living Goddess), and the nine-story Basantapur Tower. The 2015 earthquake severely damaged many structures, but restoration efforts continue.
