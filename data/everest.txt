Mount Everest and the Khumbu Region

Mount Everest, known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan, stands at 8,849 meters (29,032 feet) as the world's highest mountain. Located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas, it marks the border between Nepal and Tibet.

The first confirmed summit was achieved on May 29, 1953, by Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa from Nepal. They climbed via the South Col route, which remains the most popular climbing route today. The climbing season typically runs during two weather windows: April-May (pre-monsoon) and September-October (post-monsoon).

The Khumbu region, home to the Sherpa people, serves as the gateway to Everest. Lukla Airport, one of the world's most dangerous airports, is the starting point for most trekkers heading to Everest Base Camp. The trek takes 12-14 days round trip and passes through Namche Bazaar, the region's commercial hub.

Sagarmatha National Park, established in 1976, encompasses the Everest region and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. The park protects rare species like the snow leopard, red panda, and Himalayan monal (Nepal's national bird). Vegetation includes pine, hemlock, fir, and juniper forests at lower elevations, with alpine scrub and grasslands higher up.

Climate change poses significant threats to the Everest region. The Khumbu Glacier, through which climbers pass to reach Everest Base Camp, is rapidly retreating. Scientists have documented increased ice melt, glacier lake formation, and changes in monsoon patterns. These changes threaten both the climbing industry and local Sherpa communities who depend on tourism.
